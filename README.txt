Library Database Project

What is this?
This project is about making a database for a library. It keeps track of authors, books, members, and loans (who borrowed which book).

Tables in the database
- Authors: stores author names and their unique ID
- Books: stores book details like title, author, year, and genre
- Members: stores member names and when they joined
- Loans: stores details about borrowed books, who borrowed them, and return dates

What I did
- Created tables with primary keys to identify each record
- Linked tables using foreign keys to show relationships (like which author wrote which book)
- Added some sample data to test it
- Wrote a query to see who borrowed which book and when

How to use
1. Run the SQL script to create tables
2. Insert sample data
3. Run the query to get loan details
