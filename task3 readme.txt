Task 3 - Writing Basic SELECT Queries

This project contains SQL statements demonstrating data extraction and filtering techniques to meet the requirements of Task 3 for the SQL Developer Internship.

Concepts covered:

- Retrieve all data with SELECT *
- Filter rows with WHERE
- Use LIKE for pattern matching
- Filter rows between values with BETWEEN
- Limit the number of rows using LIMIT
- Use = for single value comparison and IN for multiple values
- Sort results descending with ORDER BY ... DESC
- Alias columns using AS
- Get unique values with DISTINCT
- Understand default sort order (ascending)

All queries use a sample table named Employees.
