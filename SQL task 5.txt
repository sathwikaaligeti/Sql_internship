CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),

INNER JOIN: Customers who have orders
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;

LEFT JOIN: All customers, with orders if any
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.amount

LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;

RIGHT JOIN: All orders, with customer information if any
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.amount

FULL OUTER JOIN: All customers and orders, matched if possible
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
