 Task 2 - Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

This project demonstrates SQL data manipulation language (DML) commands to insert, update, and delete records in a database table.

- The Employees table stores employee ID, name, and salary.
- Insertion includes rows with and without salary (NULL values).
- Updates modify salaries and handle NULL values.
- Deletion removes specific records.
- The final SELECT shows how to handle NULL salaries with the COALESCE function.
